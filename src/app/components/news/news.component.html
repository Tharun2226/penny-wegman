            <h3>Daily Herald Endorses Penny Wegman</h3>
            <p class="article-text">In the Nov. 5 election for Kane County Treasurer, Republican Gretchen Butler is challenging incumbent Democrat Penny Wegman. Wegman, seeking a second term, highlights her experience as county auditor since 2020 and her MBA. Butler emphasizes her 25 years of business experience, including managing finances in her own hardware store. Both candidates stress the need for independence in the auditor's role. Butler aims to cut costs and improve efficiency if elected. Wegman, during her term, improved transparency, launched new initiatives, and won an innovation award. While Butler is qualified, Wegman's proven record earns her the endorsement.</p>
