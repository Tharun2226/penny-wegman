        <p class="about-description">
          I provide the necessary services as expeditiously and economically as can be done while providing the same services on an equal basis to all people. My experience includes serving on the Kane County Board, serving as the Treasurer of the Kane County Forest Preserve, and Vice-Chair of the Kane County Democratic Women organization. I formerly served as a Gail Borden Public Library Trustee and President of the Kane County Regional School Board. I have lived in Elgin since 1980. I graduated from Elgin High School, attended Elgin Community College, received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Political Science from Southwest Missouri in Springfield, Missouri, and received my MBA from Keller Graduate School in 2017, with honors. I am also a Certified Illinois Assessment Officer through the Illinois Department of Revenue.

          I have chosen to stay in Kane County because it is a great place for my family to live and I want to give back to my community.
